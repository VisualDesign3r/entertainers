                    <p>Favorite things to do in Vegas: Having a glass of wine at the front bar of Mon Ami Gabi. It’s great for people and fountain watching, and you don’t have to wait ages for a balcony table.</p>
                    
                   <p> Most memorable/satisfying moment in the show: Most of our audience have never heard of us or what we do before they see the show, so it’s a nightly challenge for us to convert these people into fans. It’s always a wonderful moment when you can sense the crowd are all on your side, and are really having a great time.  </p>

                            <p>Background training/education: All of us have had singing lessons at various times in our life, as well as a few dance lessons here and there, but nothing formal. The closest thing to formal instruction we received was being part of a school-based entertainment training workshop called the “Talent Development Project” which gave talented young performers a basic grounding in things such as stagecraft, repertoire choices and other facets of live performance.
                            
                            Passions outside of work: Golf - the trick is finding time to pursue it!</p>
                            
                            <p>Favorite things to do in Vegas: Having a glass of wine at the front bar of Mon Ami Gabi. It’s great for people and fountain watching, and you don’t have to wait ages for a balcony table.</p>
                            
                           <p> Most memorable/satisfying moment in the show: Most of our audience have never heard of us or what we do before they see the show, so it’s a nightly challenge for us to convert these people into fans. It’s always a wonderful moment when you can sense the crowd are all on your side, and are really having a great time.  </p>
